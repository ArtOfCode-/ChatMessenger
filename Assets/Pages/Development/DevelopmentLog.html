    <h1>CS35/15 Development Log</h1>

        <p>
            Decided a rewrite was needed. Old CS35/15 code was unintuitive. Decided to rewrite following webserver principles:
            response codes, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rewrite begun. Keep server UI, remove status bar. Write up <code>Server.cs</code> as main task. Keep code organisation
            good: organise into folders.
        </p>

            Decided to make both server and client one executable. Lots of code that will be reused in each, why duplicate files
            and have to change both? Size not an issue.
        </p>
        <p>Start on client UI. If complete, can start writing up <code>Client.cs</code>, then test interaction.</p>
        <p>
            Thought: need to keep user informed of background operations. Status bar here would be useful: sending messages - wait
            for server to confirm. Change <code>Server.cs</code> to notify client when message processed.
        </p>

            Starting to write <code>Client.cs</code>. Have had to look up getting the Windows username to send to the server - found
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.username(v=vs.110).aspx">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>Client.cs</code> is done, now need to handle UI interaction in <code>ClientWindow.xaml.cs</code> and send relevant
            stuff to the <code>Client</code> instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>ClientWindow.xaml.cs</code> interactions are mostly complete. Now need to prompt user for IP and connect to it;
            leaving that for some other day.
        </p>

        <p>Initial code write finished. Start to debug.</p>
        <p>
            Various <code>InvalidOperationException</code>s popping up. Various methods being called by others on other threads, and UI
            objects are complaining. Look for possible instances.
        </p>
        <p><em>#1: </em>Noting unresponsiveness after clicking client Send button. Possibly because send is not on a different thread. <tag fixed /> <tag bug /> <tag norepro /></p>
        <p><em>#2: </em>Investigate strange messages - server appears to be sending back the client message <em>along with</em> the 201 Received. <tag todo /> <tag bug /></p>
        <p>
            Written up some documentation for the <code>Protocol</code> class, since it's fairly convoluted and liable to be forgotten, even with the self-explanatory nature.
        </p>

    <p>Tried to investigate #1, couldn't find the problem.</p>
    <p>Changed the <code>Client.ReceiveCallback</code> method to reset status on 101 as well. Was displaying "Sending" status from launch.</p>
    <p>Decided to commit everything to a <a href="https://github.com/ArtOfCode-/ChatMessenger">GH repo</a>, to better keep track of the code changes and issues. related custom license. all rights reserved except gh right to fork.</p>
