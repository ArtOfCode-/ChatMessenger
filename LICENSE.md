# Rights Grant

### Preamble
This is *not* an open-source project, nor a free software project. I have deliberately left this project as all rights reserved; it's in a very unfinished state and I intend to be the developer to finish it. Additionally, this document is not a license.

### Scope of this Grant
This document (the "Grant") is a record that I, the Author, grant You some rights with regards to this software project (the "Software"). The Grant covers **all** content in this Git repository, including, but not limited to, files, directories, code, and text.

### Your Rights
1. The Software, as hosted on this website (http://github.com, or "GitHub"), is required by the Terms of Service of GitHub to grant to You the right to fork this repository. You are therefore permitted to fork this repository, and to host such forks on Your account on GitHub indefinitely, subject to the following terms:

  a. You MUST retain this LICENSE file, containing this unmodified Grant. The Grant shall therefore also apply to users of GitHub and other people who view Your fork of this repository, and grant each of them the same rights.

  b. You MUST additionally retain any notices of copyright ("Copyright Notices") that exist in any files contained in this repository.

  c. You MUST NOT modify, alter or otherwise change the material from this repository. A modification shall be defined as any action which causes the computed SHA-256 hash of the entire repository to change.

2. You MAY download, build, and run the Software on any computer that is not the property of a company or business, and that is not on premises owned by any company or business. The Software shall be used solely for personal use, and not for any financial gain or monetary compensation.

3. You MUST NOT distribute, send, pass on or otherwise transmit the Software to any other person or entity.

### All Rights Reserved
All rights not expressly granted by the "Your Rights" section, above, are reserved by the Author.

The Author reserves the right to ask You to remove any public copies of the Software that he reasonably suspects are under Your control.

The Author reserves the right to revoke any of the above granted rights, at any time, for any reason.
